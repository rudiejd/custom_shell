# minsh
A very minimal shell for Unix environments. I originally implemented this as a project for a class, but I have come back to the project as an exercise to learn more about C/C++ and system calls. My plan is to attempt to use the shell as I would `bash`, then periodically provide updates that make different features possible. I will open up issues as I discover pain points in everyday shell tasks.

# usage
Right now, if you want to use `minsh`, you can just clone the repository, run `cmake CMakeLists.txt`, and mess around with the binaries. I intend to put a release tarball on here at some point.
